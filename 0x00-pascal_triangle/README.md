# Pascal's Triangle

A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row. This concept is used widely in probability, combinatorics, and algebra. Pascal's triangle is used to find the likelihood of the outcome of the toss of a coin, coefficients of binomial expansions in probability, etc.

### Task:

Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n:

<ul>
<li>Returns an empty list if n <= 0</li>
<li>You can assume n will be always an integer</li>
</ul>
