"""Write a method that determines if a given
data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Prototype: def validUTF8(data)
Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8
encoding, else return False
A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4bytes long
The data set can contain multiple characters
The data will be represented by a list of integers
Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore
you only need to handle the 8 least significant
bits of each integer
