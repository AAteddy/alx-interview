# ALX - Interview

This repo contains software engineer interview questions presented by ALX.
The goal of these questions is to assess the knowledge of Preparation Guide for Software Engineers (PGS) and provide with the best skills to overcome the process of interview.
Here I am expected to practice solving different complex problems and prepare myself to skill up and be ready for interview challenges.
